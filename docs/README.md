##### üíî Pint is now retired. It's sad to see one of my own projects to go to the history books, but maybe it's our memories with Pint that never goes away. Thank you for all the support of this project and the friends we've made along the way.

## limitations

> üí° I am still looking for ways to better implement this! if you have any idea, please open an issue or create a pull request [here](https://github.com/fuwaa/pint/issues/new/choose)

The old implementation used a `setTimeout()` function, however the delay makes the project look like garbage as you can see the original colors before seeing your palette applied. The new implementation simply throws the entire css of github and unsets it while hiding the entire html making github look like an empty page until your palette gets loaded. Slight issue though, a flicker comes from time to time but it isn't noticable.

## documentation

Documentation is planned to debut on [fuwadocs](https://docs.fuwa.sh/pint/), however it is still in progress and is quite low on the priority queue.

## contributing

contributions are welcome ‚ù§Ô∏è. however, please do keep in mind that this is a very early project and things are bound to be [messy](https://github.com/fuwaa/pint/issues/37). while code quality is my top priority, i'm implementing it as i go (which is a bit slow since I'm porting this myself to typescript) and would appreciate help regarding it so we could learn more from it too.
