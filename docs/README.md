## roadmap

please check [issues](https://github.com/fuwaa/pint/issues) for planned aditions, feature requests, bugs and more information.

alternatively, you can also open a [new issue](https://github.com/fuwaa/pint/issues/new) to add to it!

## limitations

> üí° I am still looking for ways to better implement this! if you have any idea, please open an issue or create a pull request [here](https://github.com/fuwaa/pint/issues/new/choose)

The old implementation used a `setTimeout()` function, however the delay makes the project look like garbage as you can see the original colors before seeing your palette applied. The new implementation simply throws the entire css of github and unsets it while hiding the entire html making github look like an empty page until your palette gets loaded. Slight issue though, a flicker comes from time to time but it isn't noticable.

## documentation

Documentation is planned to debut on [fuwadocs](https://docs.fuwa.sh/pint/), however it is still in progress and is quite low on the priority queue.

## contributing

contributions are welcome ‚ù§Ô∏è. however, please do keep in mind that this is a very early project and things are bound to be [messy](https://github.com/fuwaa/pint/issues/37). while code quality is my top priority, i'm implementing it as i go (which is a bit slow since I'm porting this myself to typescript) and would appreciate help regarding it so we could learn more from it too.
